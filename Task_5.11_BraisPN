**1. When do we use a ModelForm to build a form?** 

When the form data is intended to be saved directly into a database model.

**2. When do we use a Form class to build a form?** 

When the data does not map directly to a database model or requires custom logic.

**3. Difference between the get and post method in the Class Views.**

- **GET:** Handles the request to **display** the form.
- **POST:** Handles the request to **process/save** the submitted data.

**4. Is the following code correct? Explain the reason.** **No.** 

It is missing the `{% csrf_token %}` tag, which will cause a 403 Forbidden error due to security protections. It also lacks Django form rendering variables.

**5. Which of the Class Views that we have studied can be used without a model?** 

The `FormView`.

**6. Indicate the differences between the FormView and the CreateView?**

- **FormView:** Displays a form and runs logic but does not automatically save to a DB.
- **CreateView:** Is linked to a model and automatically saves the form data as a new database record.

**7. Is it necessary to have a ModelForm in order to use a CreateView? What is the advantage of using a ModelForm in this case?** 

No, it is not necessary (Django can generate it automatically if you define `model` and `fields` in the View).

Creating a ModelForm explicitly gives you full control over validation rules, CSS styling, and allows you to reuse the form in other views.
